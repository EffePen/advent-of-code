# Advent of Code Solutions üéÑüéÖ‚öôÔ∏èüí°

This repository contains my solutions to the challenges of Advent of Code.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual coding event held during the month of December. It consists of a series of 25 programming puzzles, one for each day leading up to Christmas. The puzzles cover a variety of topics such as algorithms, data structures, mathematics, and problem-solving. Participants are encouraged to solve the puzzles using any programming language of their choice.

## Structure

Each day's challenge is contained in its own directory, named according to the day of the month. Inside each directory, you will find the solution code along with any input files required to solve the puzzle.

## Usage

Feel free to browse through the solutions and use them as a reference or for inspiration. However, I encourage you to attempt the challenges on your own before looking at the solutions.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are my own implementations aimed at achieving the correct result as quickly as possible. They may not be the most optimal or efficient. There are often multiple ways to solve each puzzle, and my solutions may not always be the most elegant. They are provided here for learning and sharing purposes.
